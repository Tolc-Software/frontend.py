# Examples #

Each example is taken from the test suite for `Tolc` and, given that you use the latest version, you can expect them all to work.

Each `C++` library named `MyLib` exports as a `python module` called `MyLib`, in every test the module name is simply `m` for brevity. All tests use the `python` builtin [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) library. The examples that follow contains a bit of `C++` code, and the respective `python` code using it. Each `python` example is wrapped in the following boilerplate that is removed to make the examples more readable:

```python
import unittest
import m

class TestMyLib(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        pass

    def test_m(self):
        # The actual python example body goes here
        self.assertEqual(m.sayTen(), 10)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
